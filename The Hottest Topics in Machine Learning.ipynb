Loading the NIPS papers\n<p>The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community.

These NIPS papers are stored in <code>datasets/papers.csv</code>. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!).

Prepare the text for LDA analysis\n<p>The main text analysis method that we will use is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

First, it is necessary to convert the documents into a simple vector representation. This representation will then be used by LDA to determine the topics. Each entry of a 'document vector' will correspond with the number of times a word occurred in the document. In conclusion, we will convert a list of titles into a list of vectors, all with length equal to the vocabulary.
